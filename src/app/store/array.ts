Known for their exceptional value, Wilkinson components are reliable and perform as well as other high end parts costing several times the price. Premium Wilkinson bridges help with tone and keeping the guitar in tune, while the Wilkinson pickups provide greater depth, articulation, and balance than typical stock pickups.",
      "Solid Ash Body With Maple Neck: Unlike other guitar models using inexpensive woods, Indio Cali DLX Plus guitars feature bodies made of solid ash, which is a superior material for guitar building due to its high resonance and desirable tonal qualities. Ash is considered to be extremely balanced, creating bright but sweet tones with a slightly scooped midrange. Ash is also known for being the material used in some of the most iconic American electric guitars of all time.",
